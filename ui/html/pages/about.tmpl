        HKN stands for Eta Kappa Nu. We are an international Honor Society for Electrical and Computer Engineering. HKN at UCLA aims to enable fellow engineering students to excel in both personal and professional settings.
        <br class="mb-4">
        By organizing peer-to-peer tutoring, various workshops, review sessions, and career fairs, HKN wants to support and connect our engineering students with the best resources to enable them to succeed in academics and to explore their career options. Some of our most popular events include course review sessions, company info sessions, resume reviews, and professor lunches.
